        <h1> Viability-based control of a planar hopper </h1>
        <p> Classically, a legged robot is said to achieve stable locomotion if it converges toward a periodic limit cycle. For the simple hopper, this means achieving a constant velocity hopping gait. </p>

        </div>
        <p> However, more complex motion such as changing the direction of velocity of the gait can are by definition non-periodic. For such motion, there might be none or several limit cycles to converge toward and the classical approach no longer provides garantees that the robot will not fall over. </p>

        </div>
        <p> Our approach consists in rendering a subset of the viability kernel invariant. Inside this set, the robot is garanteed to never fall. Controlling the robot bocomes matching the desired velocity as close as possible while remaining viable. The robot below is controlled using keyboard inputs (illustrated by the green arrow) to control the hopper in real time. Despite rapid unknown changes of direction, the robot is garanteed to not fall.  </p>
